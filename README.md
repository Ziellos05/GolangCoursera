# Coursera // GO (Golang)

### This is the repository about a Go Specialization done in Coursera, the topics are many, this is a short summary about...

### Topics:

1. Basics:
   
        - Why go?
        - Compiled VS Interpreted
        - Efficiency vs easy to use
        - Garbage collection
        - OOP -> No classes -> Structs
        - Concurrency / Parallelism
        - Workspaces / Directory hierachy / Packages
        - Pointers
        - Variable Scopes
        - Stack vs Heap
        - Comments / Prints / Inputs / Outputs
        - Types in Go
        - Groups of data (Slices, hash tables. structs)
        - Protocols and formats
        - Files

2. Mid-level:

        - Functions
        - Parameters
        - Return values (And multiple returns)
        - Call by value and references
        - Passing arrays and arguments
        - Passing array pointer
        - Good practices
        - Variables as functions
        - Funcstions as arguments
        - Anonymous functions
        - Functions as return values
        - Functions defining a function
        - Variable argument number
        - Variadic slice argument
        - Deferred function calls
        - Deffered call arguments

3. Advances

        - Object Orientation in GO
        - Classes / Objects
        - Encapsulation
        - Associating methods with data
        - Implicid method arguments
        - Structs as "classes" and methods
        - Controlling access to structs
        - Point and large receivers (Not need to reference)
        - Using pointer receivers
        - Interfaces for abstraction
        - Inheritance (Not sopported in GO) (Overriding)
        - Concrete VS Interfaces Types
        - Interface values
        - Nil values, nil dynamic values and nil interface value
        - Why use interfaces? -> Empty interfaces -> Canceling Types Diferences -> Type Assertion for Desambiguation -> Type Switch -> Error Interfaces
        - Handing ERRORS

5. Go special: Concurrency

        - Why use concurrency?
        - Moore's law -> Power wall -> Dynamic power -> Multi-core systems -> Concurrent execution -> Concurrency vs Parallelism
        - Concurrent programming -> Hiding latency -> Hardware mapping in GO
        - Processes -> Scheduling -> Context Switch -> Threads VS Processes
        - GO Routines -> Go Routines Scheduler -> Interleaving -> Race conditions
        - Exiting a GO Routine -> Early exit -> Delayed exit
        - Synchonization -> Sync wait groups -> Communicating GoR -> Channels -> Buffer in channels -> Blocking -> channels capacity/buffer -> Blocking -> Receiving
        - Iterating through a channel -> Receiving multiple GoR chanels
        - Select statement -> Select send or receive -> Select with abort channel -> Default select
        - Mutual exclusion -> Mutex -> Sync.Mutex -> Mutex Methods
        - Sync initialization
        - Deadlock -> Deadlock detection
